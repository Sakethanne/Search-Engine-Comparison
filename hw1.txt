Comparing Bing (Browser assigned to me) and Google search results yields some interesting findings.
The top 10 results of Bing and Google's results overlap by an average of 20.6%, suggesting a low level of similarity. 
On the other hand, the average Spearman coefficient is -14.8415, indicating a significant disparity in the two search engines result rankings. 
This negative coefficient suggests that there are significant differences in the ranking order of shared results. 
Both the overlap percentage and Spearman coefficient measures point to a somewhat diverging performance for Bing compared to Google. 
Finally, I think Bing has performed Worse when compared to Google
